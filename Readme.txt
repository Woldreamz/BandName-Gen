Image Carousel! 
Here's how you can craft a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure for a horizontal image carousel. Keep in mind that for the images to actually display, you'll need to have the image files themselves.

How it Works

HTML: Sets up the basic container, image slide, and buttons.
CSS: Styles the elements, centers the buttons, and hides any images that don't fit within the viewable area.
JavaScript: Handles the slide transitions when the arrow buttons are clicked.
Important Notes:

Images: Replace "image1.jpg" and any subsequent image file names with the actual paths to your images.
Functionality: This is a basic carousel. Consider adding features like:
Indicators (dots) to show the current slide
Automatic slide transitions
Libraries: For richer carousels, use JavaScript libraries like Slick Carousel or Swiper.
